## Examples 5-10

**5:** adding a `++` right after the variable adds 1 to it's value. `ex5 = 5`:

``` javascript
var ex5 = 4;
ex5++;
```

**6**: adding a `--` right after the variable subtracts 1 from it's value. `ex6 = 3`:

``` javascript
var ex6 = 4;
ex6--;
```

**7**: adding a `+= #` right after the variable adds any number to it `ex7 = 6`:

``` javascript
var ex7 = 4;
ex7 += 2;
```

**8**: adding a `-= #` right after the variable subtracts any number from it. `ex8 = 2`:

``` javascript
var ex8 = 4;
ex8 -= 2;
```

**9**: adding a `*= #` right after the variable multiples it by a number. `ex9 = 8`:

``` javascript
var ex9 = 4;
ex9 *= 2;
```

**10:** adding a `/= #` right after the variable divides it by a number. `ex10 = 2`:

``` javascript
var ex10 = 4;
ex10 /= 2;
```
